CS5167 USER INTERFACE I, Dr. Jillian Aurisano

## Week 1 - Interviews and Sketching
### Interviews
The design of the smart cookbook with begin with a round of interviews. I have created 7 questions in preperation for requirements gathering. The questions are as follows:
```
1. When it comes to cooking, what does your week look like? (how many meals, how often do you cook, etc.)
2. What appliances and kitchen utensils do you use during cooking?
3. Do you look for new recipes often? If so, where, and how complex are they?
4. What makes you pick a recipe over others?
5. How do you follow a recipe while you cook? What are the pros and cons of that method?
6. Tell me about a success and a failure when it comes to cooking a new recipe.
7. What would interest you about a digital cookbook? What features do you think a digital cookbook should have?
```
In total, three interviews were conducted and their results have been recorded and formatted in the following PDF document, [accessable from this repository by clicking here](https://github.com/jack-margeson/smart-cookbook/blob/main/public/assets/Smart%20Cookbook%20Interviews.pdf).

### Sketches 
Three sessions of 10-plus-10 sketching was performed, one session each per pivotal user requirement statement:
- User wants to be able to discover recipes that match ingredients/tools they have on hand.
- User wants recipes to be easily accessable and accurate.
- User wants recipes to influence the difficulty of recipes.

The result of these sketching sessions have been attached below--**they are also available in the repository by following the hyperlinks** for a higher resolution, zoomable image:
